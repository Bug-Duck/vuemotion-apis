This is a animation api. The `moveOnPath` animation is used to move the widget on the SVG path.

API:

The type is in parentheses, and the default value is in square brackets.

- `duration`: The duration of the animation. (`number`)
- `path`: The SVG path. (`string`)

RULES:

- The animation only can be used on the widget with `x` and `y` property.
- The animation will be used on the widget that has the same level with the widget that you want to animate.
