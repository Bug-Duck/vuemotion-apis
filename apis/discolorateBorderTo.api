This is a animation api. The animation is used to change the border color of the widget.

API:

The type is in parentheses, and the default value is in square brackets.

- `duration`: The duration of the animation. (`number`)
- `by`: The timing function. (`(t: number) => number`) [t => t]
- `to`: The last value of the color, it can be RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA, and CSS color string. (`string`)

RULES:

- `to` is required, it is the final color.
- The animation only can be used on the widget with `border-color` property.
